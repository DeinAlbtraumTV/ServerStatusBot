# ServerStatusBot
A simple Bot that allows to check for the status of any mc server/server. No hosting provided, you need to host the bot for yourself. A Token is entered via the config. Just run the bot once to create it.


Just download the ServerStatusBot.jar file in the build/libs folder and execute it.

It generates a bot_config.json file where you need to enter the Token of your Bot and set a game which he will be playing.

Then you execute the file again and the Bot should be running!
